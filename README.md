# shell-in-C
> This project can create a new shell, which have the same built-in command as the orginal shell(such as `cd` `pwd` `mkdir` `cp`). In addition, I built two additional useful commands in the new shell: `printf` and `alias`.

## Usage
##### 1. Use `Makefile` to generate `.o` and execution file `mysh`
###### command:
`make mysh`
##### 2. Execute `mysh`
###### command:
`./mysh`
